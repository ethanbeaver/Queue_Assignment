//Constructor Function:

template <class T>

template <class T>

bool Queue<T>::emptyQ()
{
    if(front==rear)
        return true;

//Full Check Function:
//Checks to see if the queue is full, by checking the positions of the front and rear pointer.
//If the rear pointer is one position behind the front, the queue is full.
//Wraparound is handled by making the addition operation modular.

//Add Queue Function:
//First, checks for a full queue. If there is room in the queue, the rear position is moved to the next available spot.
//The element is added, and a message is displayed.

//Delete Queue Function:
//First, checks for an empty queue. If there are indeed elements in the queue, the front pointed element is returned,
//and the front pointer is moved one spot forward. This effectively removes the element, as it is overwritten when the rear loops back around to it.

//Length Queue Function:
//Checks for the number of active elements in the queue, by measuring the distance between the front and the rear.
//If the rear has a greater value than the front, a simple rear-front operation is performed, and the difference is output as the length.
//If the front has a greater value than the rear, rear - front is performed, but the size of the queue is added to give an accurate, positive valued length.

//Write Queue Function
//This function outputs the elements in the queue, along with null characters for empty elements, in their corresponding positions.
//If the queue is not empty, the process begins. If the rear pointer is greater than the front pointer, a third pointer works from
//the 0th element of the array to the final element. Each element is checked. If it falls inside the front <-> rear range, the value of the array is returned.
//Otherwise, a null character is printed.
//If the front pointer is greater than the rear pointer, the same 0 to final loop is run, but here, elements that are either less than the rear,
//or greater than the front are returned. Else, the null character is returned.
